00:00:45 Pursuit squad, report the current positions of Units 02-Dash and 08.
00:00:56 Unit 02-Dash has achieved operational altitude. It is now within range of the targeted orbit. 
00:01:01 Unit 08 was unable to breach target orbital range due to insufficient altitude. 
00:01:05 Copy that.
00:01:06 02-Dash will conduct a solo operation. 
00:01:11 Roger. Unit 08 will act as support. Transition shift to 7
00:01:09 Unit 02-Dash is beyond the point of recovery. It is breaching Area 88. 
00:01:16 Roger. Commence Operation UA
00:01:24 Roger. Unit 02-Dash will enter the final operational orbit. Deceleration in progress. 
00:01:27 Inducing a Stage 1 spark within all engines. 
??:??:?? Combustion imminent. 
00:01:34 S1C combustion complete. Deceleration confirmed
00:01:41 Jettisoning booster unit, stage 1.
00:01:43 Confirmed, ascertaining visual status. 
??:??:?? We're all clear. 
00:01:47 Roger. Automating ignition timing. Igniting all engines, stage 2
00:01:56 S1C combustion complete. Closing pressure valves
00:01:57 Jettisoning booster unit, stage 2
00:02:00 Deceleration complete
00:02:02 Preparing to enter final operational orbit. Flipping unit  head. Commencing rotation. 
00:02:09 Descent angle confirmed to be within an acceptable margin of error.
00:02:10 Recalculating relative velocity.
??:??:?? No problems.
00:02:16 Final orbit corrections complete.
00:02:18 180-degree rotation complete.
00:02:20 Roger. Unit 02-Dash will transition to the intersection orbit. Now commencing the operation
00:02:26 All remote guiding will now be cut. Unit will be controlled manually
00:02:30 Good luck.
00:02:33 Unit is on course to intersect with the target. Eight miles until contact.
00:02:38 Confirming target.
00:02:39 Contact point is unchanged.
00:02:40 Maintaining Shift-M. No problems.
00:02:43 02-Dash, prepare to rendezvous. Eva-08 is lacking altitude, so it can only assist you in the 96 seconds until re-entry
00:02:50 Finish this by then
00:02:54 Reflective waves detected in target space. It's jamming us!
00:02:57 It's just the auto-defense system's mass weapon. No need to worry
00:03:02 Burst flows generated!
00:03:04 Incoming in 3... 2... 1...
00:03:10 Second wave incoming. Blood type: blue.
00:03:13 They're a pesky bunch.
00:03:14 Identifying approaching body...
00:03:15 Confirmed to be Code 04A.
00:03:25 An Anti-A.T. Field!
00:03:32 This sucks!
00:03:34 It's just getting in my way!
00:03:38 Hey, four eyes! Support me!
00:03:45 Support fire was two seconds late!
00:03:50 And you're three seconds ahead of position.
00:03:52 It's called adapting to the situation. Keep up with me!
00:03:55 As you wish,
00:03:57 Princess!
00:04:06 [It/I] got through the Fraury Shift.
00:04:07 I(t)'ll break into Final Defense Area 89.
00:04:10 The target is moving!
00:04:16 No time to correct my orbit!
00:04:17 I'm going in!
00:04:40 Decelerate!
00:04:46 Eight!
00:04:47 Seven!
00:04:48 Six!
00:04:49 Five!
00:04:50 Four!
00:04:51 Three!
00:04:53 Two!
00:04:54 One!
00:04:55 Terminating combustion!
00:05:04 02-Dash has jettisoned the last boosters.
00:05:06 Ensuring safe distance for re-entry.
00:05:10 Successfully seized the target. Returning.
00:05:13 Roger
00:05:14 We'll be waiting at the retrieval point.
00:05:16 The join code is Saturn 5
00:05:17 Roger.
00:05:19 Blood type blue? Where?!
00:05:25 The triggering object is Code 04B.
00:05:27 It's deploying indo-hashamas.
00:05:29 What nerve!
00:05:30 Right before re-entry, too.
00:05:33 Four eyes, back-up!
00:05:36 Sorry!
00:05:37 I don't have enough altitude, so c'ya!
00:05:39 I'll leave the rest to y-...
00:05:42 Ugh! She's useless!
00:05:44 Damn, this thing is stubborn!
00:05:46 Nobody told me about this!
00:05:59 What's with this light?!
00:06:01 It's ignoring the AT field!
00:06:03 Gotta do a core block!
00:06:06 You're not getting away!
00:06:10 Crap! I can't maintain my descent angle!
00:06:12 My unit will break apart at this rate!
00:06:14 02-Dash, completing the mission is the utmost priority!
00:06:18 Don't let go of the target object, even if it means sacrificing the unit.
00:06:20 I already know that!
00:06:41 Do something, idiot-Shinji!
00:07:23 Welcome back, Ikari Shinji-kun.
00:07:26 I've been waiting.
00:07:42 Cardiopulmonary function is nominal. No discernible paralysis of the extremities. Yes. His eyes are opening.
00:07:51 Can you understand me?
00:07:56 What is this place?
00:07:58 He's responsive. He seems to have returned to a conscious state.
00:08:03 I'm sure I saved Ayanami...
00:08:07 Yes, continuity of memory also appears acceptable.
00:08:11 Um, where's Ayanami...?
00:08:13 Is this someone you know?
00:08:18 It's ... me.
00:08:21 He possesses self-recognition, as well. Problems are unlikely.
00:08:24 What is this?
00:08:29 [incomplete transcription] ...installation list cleared up to 86%.
00:08:31 In-operation N2 Reactor maintaining output of 90%
00:08:34-00:08:52 - 検体、DM03、拘引しました <Unsure exactly this was said>
00:08:33–00:08:52 - <Overspeaking by various people>
00:08:54 Specimen DM03is in our custody.
00:08:56 Understood. Release the restraints.
00:09:02 You can step down.
00:09:26 Misato.
00:09:28 It is Ikari Shinji-kun, isn't it?
00:09:31 I suppose. His physical data is identical to Code Third Child. Post birth dental treatment scars, body composition, everything matches 100%.
00:09:43 We are now analyzing his inner Sync Test results.
00:09:47 How about the DSS choker?
00:09:50 it has already been installed. Captain Katsuragi. (Note. Captain of a ship. Not military captain.)
00:09:52 Captain Katsuragi... It is you after all!
00:10:03 Activation Nominal. Passcode is set exclusive to the Captain.
00:10:07 Understood.
00:10:12 What is this?! Please, take it off already.
00:10:19 That's never going to be taken off.
00:10:22 Interview complete. Take him to quarantine.
00:10:27 ＃＃＃01 and 05 destroyed。＃＃＃insufficient 
00:10:32 What's this? 
00:10:34 Pattern Blue. Target identified. Altitude 4C. It's the Nemesis Series. (Nemejesu Shiri-su. Other interpretations?) 
00:10:39 They came again? 
00:10:40 It is advancing 3-dimensionally. It's trying to seal us in. 
00:10:45 We cannot afford to move from here yet. Carry out just the connection procedures。(I have no context due to not listening to the rip. It might mean connection procedure for the EVA units, or the ships of the fleet. Please feel free to edit this. ) 
00:10:51 All fleets. Second battle stations. Target: All Nemesis Series. 
00:10:55 Roger. Second battle stations. 
00:10:59 Prepare for Anti-air, Anti-water, and underwater battle. 
00:11:02 Abandon stock transfer. Prioritise the transferring all personel to another vessel. 
00:11:05 All fleets, abandoning stock transfer. All personel, transferring vessels is top priority! 
00:11:13 All aircrafts are to withdraw from our current air space.　Move swiftly to Meeting Point 2。 
00:11:19 Abandon any left over cargo. Migration of crew is the top priority。 
00:11:31 Remote control and Interlock Systems, activate. 
00:11:35 Initiate main power system injection. Hurry. 
00:11:39 L2 Reactor operating at 99% 
00:11:43 Initiating main power system injection. Opening valves up to number 90. 
00:11:46 Transmission pipe connected. 
00:11:49 No problems detected in the port, and 3rd and 4th cargo cage. 
00:11:51 Roger. Opening all valves up to 90. Begin energy injection. 00:11:56 Injecting power to reactor L2. All nominal. 
00:11:58 LCL 13-born electricity, confirming ### system. (unsure of transcription here) 
00:12:03 Battle stations! Get in our previous departments. Hey you there! No standing around! 
00:12:08 It's impossible, Ma'am (head of mechanics/maintence department). I mean, we're just a group of civilians that got mixed in! 
00:12:14 No excuses! Get your hands moving! Ugh, this is what's wrong with young men 
00:12:21 ummm、they said to stop transfer procedures here, and commence locking down the wall barrier...now? 
00:12:28 (対空艦種を弦として、トナーの工員はこれ。) ????? I can't quite make sense of this one. 
00:12:31 Kitakami! What's the status of the procedures on deck? 
00:12:34 Am I in charge of that?? 
00:12:37 That's your post! Of course!! 
00:12:38 Ehhh? For real?? 
00:12:43 Activation is dangerous. Let's stay here! 
00:12:50 Though, having battle stations on the bridge. It makes me nervous~ 
00:12:52 Roger, activate all anti-air systems. Safeguarding Unit 01 is top priority. 
00:12:57 Eva-01? 
00:13:07 It's here. Confirming the target's mass of light. Ummm it's somewhat increasing in numbers. 
00:13:13 We can't grasp the target's core block. It is probably ### concealed in the air space outside. (incomplete transcript here) 
00:13:19 This is bad. At this rate, ### saturated attack. (transcript) 
00:13:22 600 seconds until contact. 
00:13:24 Captain Katsuragi. I propose an immediate dispersal of the fleets. In our current state #### and ####. Also this main ship's comouflage equipment is incomplete. 
00:13:35 On top of that, we cannot grasp the target's core block. In other words, our chance of winning is zero. 
00:13:42 We should retreat from here as usual. There is no way. Captain Katsuragi! 
00:13:48 Precisely because of that、I will change the current situation and cut off any anxiety. Vice captain, we're going to fly. 
00:13:54 Fly?! You can't be thinking of using the main unit? 
00:13:58 All fleet, prepare for launch! Main unit, prepare for ignition!
00:14:03 It's too reckless to use the main ship all of a sudden, Captin Katsuragi! 
00:14:06 I agree. We haven't even run a test flight. It's too dangerous. 
00:14:11 Anti-gravity also hasn't been tested. I don't have confidence in it. 
00:14:14 I don't want to fight battles that can't be won. I don't want to die yet. 
00:14:17 We die when we die. That is all there is. Quit complaining, younglings. 
00:14:21 Wah... Elders should be more careful! 
00:14:25 I am aware of the recklessness. We will use this ship as decoy and fish it out to the surface! 
00:14:30 The power to kill god. I will see it through to the end. 
00:14:34 But the most important ignition system has not been installed. Don't tell me, you're going to use EVA? 
00:14:40 Mari! 
00:14:40 Eva-08 can't do it yet. 
00:14:42 Asuka, 
00:14:43 Asuka? 
00:14:46 I'm already doing it! I just have to shove the ignition engine in right? 
00:14:49 I'm counting on you. 
00:14:51 But there is problem with the barrier density around the ship.、Plus the bridge is in operation isn't it? 
00:14:56 Well, prioritise our purpose. Neglecting life is that guy's (?) motto afterall. I'm going all out! EVA Unit 02', activate! 
00:15:06 Take off. 
00:15:07 Roger.
00:15:09 Underwater motor and jet propulsion, passing through number 1.
00:15:21 It's my long awaited new ???, this is a boring entrance... 
00:15:32 It really is Eva-02. Thank god. Asuka is okay. 
00:15:40 Misato, I... 
00:15:43 All fleets, to Primary Battle Stations. 
00:15:47 All fleets, to Primary Battle Stations. Repeat, All fleets, to Primary Battle Stations. 
00:15:51 Changing battle command system. Main crew, to the main bridge. 
00:15:57 Prepare Gravity Blast. 
00:15:59 Roger. All vents, check. 
00:16:00 Main control unit concentrated in Ankri(?) Plug 
00:16:03 Roger. Prepare for descent. Inductor, confirmed. Enerting countdown. 
00:16:10 Misato! Eva-01 is here, isn't it? I will pilot too! I will help Asuka! 
00:16:20 Don't you need me to pilot Eva-1, Misato?! 
00:16:26 That's right. There's no need for you to pilot Eva. 
00:16:32 Command system is currently being transferred to the battle ship bridge. Repeat. Command system is currently being transferred to the battle ship bridge. 
00:16:36 No need?.. Then, um, what should I do? Misato!! 
00:16:47 Ikari Shinji-kun. You... just.. don't do anything.
00:17:05 LCL filled. Additional density Clear. 
00:17:10 Entry Start 
00:17:10 LCL nominal. Startings all collation systems. 
00:17:15 What's the status? 
00:17:16 All personel roll-call complete. All confirmed aboard. 
00:17:18 Injecting power for initial system activation. 5% until critical point.

00:17:38 Target is still closing in.It has taken an enveloping form. 
00:17:40 Deploy Unit 02 propellors. Reinstalling towers. 
00:17:46 here we go~ 
00:17:54 Well then! 
00:17:57 Let's do it! 
00:18:06 Spreading A.T. Field! 
00:18:08 It changed into a pillar of light.
00:18:12 miru-miru energy (context?!) is increasing!! 
00:18:13 ##### started moving. 
00:18:18 Ally ships have been evaporated! 
00:18:20 It's a saturated attack. If this ship gets caught too, it's all over. 
00:18:25 360 seconds until #### 
00:18:39 再受動機(Passive engine?!?!?!?) Sequence Start. 
00:18:41 300%！ 
00:18:43 No matter! Transfer all energy to the Fly Wheel (???). Top priority! 
00:18:57 7th convert group, exploded! 
00:19:02 As long as it's gone down! Don't worry about it! Continue the regulation injection! Disregard all pressure meters! 
00:19:06 Releasing the lock on the fly wheel crimp. 
00:19:07 Begin rotation. 
00:19:18 Energy pump initiate. 
00:19:19 ##### output to 80% 
00:19:22 Force entry of catalyst 
00:19:43 39 seconds 
00:19:48 It's there. Fly wheel charged to 102%, over critical. 
00:19:53 #### final stage 
00:19:54 roger. switch to flight control. 
00:19:57 Roger. Starting ground to air regulation. Transferring to 3 dimensional type steering.

00:20:17 Ignite! 
00:20:18 Eeeeeeeiiiiii~ 
00:20:33 Obstacles cleared. 
00:20:36 Confirming all divisions. Consort ships have all retreated. 
00:20:38 Here we go. Wunder, launch! 
00:21:31 Main wing penetrated! Damage unknown! 
00:21:32 Don't sweat it. Prepare for an electrical attack. 
00:21:35 (ハォートーリ ゾースパー　グーターン　ヨーソロー
# ヨーソロー is a sea term. I could not undastand other three words.) (Naval blabber _) 
00:21:45 We are going to pull out the core block from #####. 
00:21:53 A crack has been sustained on the end of the main wing. 
00:21:55 Evasive maneuvers at full capacity. 
00:21:59 Full power on both sides.
00:22:01 Full speed ahead. 
00:22:29 It appeared. It's the core block. 
00:22:31 Now! Port full power. Swing it around. 
00:23:02 Thruster. full power!　Sudden brake! 
00:23:13 Target is silent. 
00:23:14 All cannons prepare to fire!　Load energy penetrating ammunition. 
00:23:17 Connect all cannons to main ship.　Open ammunition supplying circuit! 
00:23:21 Roger. Opening circuit. 
00:23:23 Adjusting ### discrepencies to bare sufficient levels. 
00:23:25 Shooting bank activation equipment. 
00:23:27 Direct aim and manual pursuit, all good to go. 
00:23:30 That's good then. FIRE! 
00:23:57 Target destroyed. 
00:23:58 ASll fleets, second alert. Section staff, prepare to retrieve Eva-02. Hurry with emergency procedures for the main wing. 
00:24:06 Amazing! 
00:24:08 We really won. 
00:24:10 How totally reckless. Well, she's an even more interesting captain than Kaji said. 
00:24:15 So this is the power to kill gods. This really is the ship of hope. 
00:25:00 Specimen DM03、a.k.a. Ikari Shinji. The vice chief will have a word with you.
00:25:07 This is Eva-01. 
00:25:08 Eva-01 is being used as the main engine of this ship. You being a pilot is unnecessary.
00:25:17 Ah, so I'm really not needed. 
00:25:19 Also, your sync test results have come back. The sync rate is 0.00%.
00:25:26 Even if you were to board the Eva, it wouldn't activate.
00:25:31 Is that so? Isn't that good news, Ikari-san?
00:25:33 Even so, we cannot overlook the fact that, earlier, Eva-01 suddenly entered an awakened state for 12 seconds. 
00:25:40 As a result, the DSS choker has been installed on you.
00:25:45 What is this?
00:25:46 Safety for us. It's a physical safety device to avoid awakening. 
00:25:51 And it is also a symbol of your punishment.
00:25:55 What does it do?
00:25:57 If you lose control of your emotions while piloting Eva and become unable to suppress the Awakening risk, 
00:26:04 this will intervene by terminating your life.
00:26:10 Does that mean... I will die?
00:26:14 I will not deny that.
00:26:17 No way...
00:26:19 Misato-san, what is this about dying? 
00:26:22 This is weird, Misato-san! Suddenly it's all so confusing and I don't understand anything!
00:26:27 It can't be helped that you're confused. Second Lt.
00:26:29 Yes!
00:26:31 Introduce yourself.
00:26:31 Right. Um, it's late, but I'm the medical officer in charge, 2nd Lt. Suzuhara Sakura. Nice to meet you. 
00:26:43 Ah, s-same.
00:26:47 But, Suzuhara... Toji's? 
00:26:51 Ah, yes. You've helped my big brother. I'm his little sister Sakura. 
00:26:54 Little sister? Don't you mean big sister? 
00:26:58 Yes, his little sister. 
00:27:00 L-little sister...? How? 
00:27:05 14 years have passed since then. Stupid Shinji. 
00:27:09 Huh? Ah, Asuka! 
00:27:14 Thank god. You're safe, Asuka!
00:27:20 I can't stand this. I've been holding this in.
00:27:35 What was that about...
00:27:36 Built up anger and grief. 
00:27:40 What do you mean...? Ah, Asuka, your left eye... 
00:27:44 None of your business.
00:27:45 Asuka, you said it's been 14 years, but the only thing that's changed about you is that eyepatch.
00:27:52 Right. It's the Eva's Curse. 
00:27:56 Curse? 
00:28:00 Wait! Asuka, maybe you know! Where's Ayanami?! 
00:28:06 Dunno. 
00:28:07 You don't know...? But I saved her! 
00:28:10 All this fuss over just one person. 
00:28:12 This world doesn't have time to cater to your ego. 
00:28:16 Isn't that right, Captain Katsuragi? 
00:28:23 Asuka!
00:28:24 Misato-san, where's Ayanami?! Please, tell me! 
00:28:27 Shinji-kun, Ayanami Rei no longer exists.
00:28:31 No, I saved her, I know I did. 
00:28:34 She must still be in Eva-01's plug. 
00:28:37 Please, search for her! 
00:28:38 We've already conducted a thorough sweep of Eva-01. 
00:28:42 We only found you.
00:28:45 And for some reason, this was restored. 
00:28:49 The inspection yielded no problems. We'll return it.
00:28:52 My father's... 
00:28:55 Ayanami was holding it then. 
00:28:58 So I saved her, didn't I?
00:29:02 What?!
00:29:05 It's me!
00:29:07 Target is on the rear deck! It suddenly closed in on us!
00:29:09 The favorite has appeared, huh!
00:29:11 All fleets to First battle stations. Safeguarding Eva-01 is top priority!
00:29:15 Eva-08 is ready to go, right?
00:29:17 Of course the course~ I'm doing it now~
00:29:20 By the way, how was Puppy Boy? Is he obediently staying put?
00:29:26 何も変わらず、＃＃＃で馬鹿な顔してた。
00:29:29 その顔、見に行ったんじゃないの～？
00:29:32 違う！眺めに行っただけ！これでスッキリした。
00:29:36 Misato-san, Ritsuko-san! Just who is coming? Is it a new Angel?!
00:29:41 Ikari-kun, where are you?
00:29:44 Ayanami. That was Ayanami's voice just now, wasn't it!? Misa-
00:29:53 What is up with this!?
00:29:55 Preparations complete! Ikari-san, this way!
00:29:59 Ikari-kun, where are you?
00:30:02 It really is Ayanami.
00:30:04 It's Ayanami!
00:30:07 Ikari-san! Quickly!
00:30:12 Enough. Ayanami, I'm right here!
00:30:28 Eva... Unit 00.
00:30:31 Ikari-kun, come this way.
00:30:35 Don't do it, Shinji-kun. 
00:30:37 Just stay put here.
00:30:39 What's with that, Misato-san? 
00:30:41 Just before you were saying I was no longer needed!
00:30:43 Even so, you'll be kept in our custody.
00:30:46 That's just too one-sided!
00:30:54 Please stop it! The target is an Eva!
00:30:56 That's why. 
00:30:57 We will eradicate all of Nerv's Evas.
00:30:59 Nerv... Isn't this Nerv here, too?!
00:31:03 We are Wille, an organization dedicated to Nerv's destruction.
00:31:08 That's... No, but it's being piloted by Ayanami!
00:31:13 It's not her! Rei is gone, Shinji-kun.
00:31:16 Liar! I mean, she's right here, isn't she?!
00:31:19 You're just daft, Misato-san! I've had enough!
00:31:25 Ikari-san! 
00:31:27 Even if you leave, 
00:31:29 Please just don't pilot an Eva!
00:31:32 I really do want you to forgive me...
00:31:43 Four eyes, don't let it get away! 
00:31:44 Loud and clear!
00:31:53 ♪ Don't miss when you aim at your target ♪
00:31:55 Hey, come on!
00:32:02 Alright!
00:32:09 I knew it! An Adams' vessel? 
00:32:18 挨拶くらいしてけよこなろー！
00:32:23 The fact he was taken in priority over Eva-01 means he still has potential as a trigger! 
00:32:27 Misato! Use the DSS choker! 
00:32:45 Mission directive from Executive Officer. Pursuit unnecessary. All personnel, resume emergency damage control and camouflage operation.
00:32:50 Roger. Resume emergency damage control and camoflouge operation.
00:32:55 Hmph, what do you know. He's not an idiot, he's a brat.
00:33:16 I did save her after all. Misato-san is a liar.
00:33:21 This way.
00:33:33 Um...
00:33:49 Even though this is the Geofront... you can see the sky.
00:34:01 Is that... Nerv Headquarters? What happened?
00:34:38 It really has been 14 years.
00:35:16 Here.
00:35:20 What's this? An Eva...?
00:35:25 That's right.
00:35:28 Father...
00:35:30 Evangelion 13, a unit for you and that pilot.
00:35:38 The one on the piano just earlier?
00:35:42 When the time comes, pilot this Eva along with that boy. We are done talking.
00:35:48 Wait a second, Father! I still have a lot of questions, a lot I want to talk about! Father!
00:36:06 There's no dial tone, so I can't reach anyone from here.
00:36:32 I really should get going.
00:36:43 Ayanami! 
00:36:47 Ayanami, where are you? 
00:36:51 Ayanami----!
00:37:27 That's weird, this place is... Ayanami?! There you are!
00:37:36 I've been looking for you！Ah! Um. Ah, Wait... clothes! Put some clothes on! 
00:37:46 If that is an order, I will do it. 
00:37:49 I'm coming in... 
00:37:55 Um, Ayanami, thank you. I've been wanting to thank you for a while. 
00:38:10 Your plugsuit got renewed. It suits you. Though black is a little...
00:38:22 Nerv HQ has changed quite a lot, hasn't it?
00:38:29 Why is Misato fighting against Nerv and not the Angels? 
00:38:32 What does father intend to do here? What's happened to everyone?
00:38:39 Hey, Ayanami, do you know anything? 
00:38:43 I do not. 
00:38:44 I see... Say, when did you return from Eva-01? 
00:38:59 This place isn't much of a room. 
00:39:03 You could say it's just your style, but it doesn't seem like there is school, so what do you do all the time? 
00:39:11 Wait. For orders. 
00:39:15 There are no books here. You're not reading any books? 
00:39:19 Books? Would Rei Ayanami read books? 
00:39:25 Yes. Doesn't she? She had books in her room... 
00:39:28 I see... 
00:39:31 I got it. I'll go look for some books in the library here and bring you some. 
00:39:35 Um, maybe English books? You always used to have one with you and seemed like you like them. 
00:39:41 "Like"... 
00:39:42 Yeah... At least, I think so. 
00:39:46 What is "like"? 
00:39:57 Is Rei still silent? 
00:40:01 The Human Instrumentality Project will be carried out according to the Dead Sea Scrolls. 
00:40:05 We no longer need to weave the story. 
00:40:09 Ikari, you plan to use Eva-13 this time? 
00:40:15 No matter. I will follow your plan, for Yui-kun. 
00:40:25 It's no use, it won't move.
00:40:36 Don't do anything. 
00:40:37 It has nothing to do with you. 
00:40:38 Please, just don't pilot the Eva! 
00:40:40 Get in the Eva. 
00:40:41 I don't know. 
00:41:37 Come down here, Ikari-kun, let's talk!
00:41:46 U-Uh, aren't we going to talk?
00:41:49 I wanted to talk about a possible duet on the piano. A dialogue of sounds. Why don't we try it?
00:41:58 Ah, it's fine. I can't do that.
00:41:57 If you want to live well, you have to change and try new things. 
00:42:09 Look, it's easy. You just have to hit this key here.  
00:42:28 Now, follow along with me. 
00:42:54 That sounds so nice. Each note is so pleasurable.
00:43:33 You're playing so well. We're amazing together, aren't we?
00:43:43 Thanks, it feels like it's been a while since I've had so much fun.
00:43:46 Me too. Let's meet again sometime. You can come whenever, Ikari Shinji-kun.
00:43:52 Yeah. Oh- Who are you?
00:43:56 I'm Kaworu, Nagisa Kaworu. I'm the same as you, a child chosen by fate.
00:44:10 She's still not here. The books are the same too. 
00:44:30 Good morning, Ikari Shinji-kun. You're here early today.
00:44:36 I don't really have anything else to do.
00:45:07 I wonder how I could play it better...
00:45:11 There is no need to play well. Just producing a pleasing sound will suffice.   
00:45:18 Then, I want to make it sound better, how do I do that?
00:45:22 Memorization and practice.　
00:45:26 Doing it over and over until it feels good enough to you. 
00:45:30 That's the only way.
00:46:02 It's okay, leave it to me. Just move along.
00:46:05 Um, thank you. I feel bad for making you do so much for me.
00:46:12 You don't need to worry about that. We're friends.
00:46:19 It's gotten quite dark, hasn't it? Why don't we head back for today?
00:46:23 Hey, why don't we stay here for a little longer? 
00:45:26 We could watch the stars lfrom here.
00:46:28 The stars...?
00:46:31 Do you like the stars?
00:46:34 Yeah, ever since I was little, 
00:46:39 it's struck me how large the universe is; I feel marginalized, but in a humbling way
00:46:44 In my 14 years of life it hasn't changed a bit...
00:46:49 It calms me down, if that makes sense. 
00:46:55 Ah, it's difficult to put it into words. 
00:46:58 Your feelings came through. 
00:47:01 You don't seek change, but rather desire stability in the world. 
00:47:06 It's like you.
00:47:09 Lying here together is nice. 
00:47:12 I didn't know it could be so pleasant. 
00:47:16 Thanks for inviting me.
00:47:18 No, you don't need to. 
00:47:20 I just thought that it'd be fun, if you wanted to try it, and-
00:47:26 It is fun. 
00:47:30 I really was born to meet you.
00:47:50 Hm? I wonder if it's still noticeable...
00:47:54 Huh?
00:48:00 Here, it should work now.
00:48:03 Thanks, you're amazing, Nagisa-kun. You can do everything.
00:48:08 This is just knowledge. It's because I've stayed in this world for a little longer than you.
00:48:15 But still... You're amazing.
00:48:19 You don't look too well. What's wrong?
00:48:26 I'm worried about my friends.
00:48:30 Friends?
00:48:31 Yes. Above Nerv HQ there was a city. Everyone lived there. 
00:48:37 Toji, Kensuke, Prez, everyone...
00:48:42 Apparently I had been sleeping in Eva-01 for 14 years. 
00:48:45 I don't know what's changed in that time...
00:48:50 Not knowing the answer to that must be painful.
00:48:53 Somehow, I'm scared. 
00:48:57 Of what's happened to the city and everybody,
00:49:02 I'm scared of it for some reason. 
00:49:04 That's right, I'm scared!
00:49:15 Do you want to know?
00:49:45 Nagisa-kun! Nagisa-kun!
00:50:03 Just a little longer now.
00:50:22 The clouds will disperse soon, and you will see the truth you desire.
00:50:36 What is this...? 
00:50:43 The outcome of Third Impact, which came to pass while you were merged with Eva-01. 
00:50:51 This is... What happened to everyone in the city? 
00:50:55 Mass extinction is not unusual on this planet. 
00:50:58 Rather, it is the aspect that drives evolution. 
00:51:02 Because life is fundamentally something that adjusts to the world and changes itself. 
00:51:09 However, Lilin do not change themselves, but the world. 
00:51:15 So they brought the rite of artificial evolution unto themselves. 
00:51:21 Old life is offered in sacrifice, to facilitate the birth of new beings blessed by the Fruit of Life.
00:51:29 This fateful cycle of destruction and rebirth is the product of archaic programming. 
00:51:33 Nerv call it the Human Instrumentality Project. 
00:51:38 This is Nerv's-- what my father was doing. 
00:51:48 Ikari Shinji-kun, once awakened, Eva-01 became the trigger for Third Impact and opened the Door of Guf. 
00:51:58 Lilin call it Near Third Impact. It was all initiated by you. 
00:52:08 You're wrong! All I did was save Ayanami! 
00:52:16 True, but that was the catalyst...
00:52:21 All this... I didn't know. You're telling me all of it so quickly, and there's nothing I can do about it! 
00:52:31 Indeed. There's nothing you can do about your past. 
00:52:35 The truth you desired to know. 
00:52:38 The Lilin are providing you reparation for your sin as a result. 
00:52:43 That's what your neck device is, no? 
00:52:48 What sin? I didn't do anything. I had nothing to do with it! 
00:52:54 If it wasn't you, then who was it?  
00:52:58 However, no sin is beyond redemption.
00:53:02 There is always hope. Always. 
00:53:23 Seele's boy has contacted the Third Boy.
00:53:27 He showed him the conditions outside, it seems.
00:53:30 Was his reaction as you anticipated?
00:53:33 Are you okay with all of this, Ikari?
00:53:35 Seele's scenario is being rewritten by us.
00:53:39 All existence follows the tools for that purpose. 
00:53:42 If you flaunt your way of life, [can't figure out "naranto suru"].
00:53:48 私はそうは思わんがな。
00:53:53 何でだよ・・・。
00:53:56 何でことになってるなんて・・・。
00:54:03 そうだ・・・綾波を助けたんだ。
00:54:06 それでいいじゃないか・・・。
00:54:33 またいない。まだ読んでない・・・。
00:54:39 なんだよ・・・綾波もどうしちゃったんだよ・・・！
00:54:53 Third Boy, do you play shogi? 
00:54:57 Eh... I only sort of know the rules. 
00:55:00 That's fine. 付き合いたまえ。
00:55:03 飛車角金は落としてやる。
00:55:13 心を静かに落ち着かせ。
00:55:16 戦いに勝つために必要ことだ。
00:55:19 三十一手先で、君の積みだ。
00:55:31 ふーむ・・・・・これなら楽しめるか？
00:55:35 老人の趣味に付き合ってくれて、礼を言う。
00:55:42 私も臆病でね。口実でもなければこうして君と話す機会を持てなかった。
00:55:50 Do you remember your mother?
00:55:55 No. まだ小さかったし。それに・・・母のものはすべて父が処分したので。
00:56:07 Is this... Ayanami?
00:56:13 Your mother. Maiden name, Ayanami Yui.
00:56:16 She was my student at the university.
00:56:20 Now, she is the control system of Eva Unit 01.
00:56:27 Hm. The power was finally restored.
00:56:33 The control system from very early in the Evas' development.
00:56:38 Here, Yui-kun proposed direct entry into cores,
00:56:42 and tested it with herself as the experimentee.
00:56:46 You were watching, too. Your memory must have been erased.
00:56:56 The result was that Yui-kun vanished here, and only her data was recovered, in the Ayanami Series.
00:57:03 The Rei you know is one of the clones of Yui-kun.
00:57:08 She is preserved within Eva-01, the same as your mother.
00:57:13 All of it is Ikari's plan.
00:57:17 No way...
00:57:20 Destroying the world is not difficult, either. 
00:57:24 But where rebuilding is concerned, that's not the case. 
00:57:28 The world can be reversed no more than time. Nor even the human heart...
00:57:35 And thus, so that his wish might be granted, Ikari is paying every price there is. 
00:57:41 Even his very soul.
00:57:44 I've imparted to you a little of the truth. Even about your father.
00:58:01 He's (?) truly in an inenviable position. 
00:58:04 Yui-kun, this should do. 
[Fuyutsuki overloaded my grammar receptacles; someone double-check the above, please.]
00:58:15 The time of the final contract is upon us.
00:58:20 Wait just a little longer, Yui.
00:58:31 なんで本、読まないんだよ・・・。
00:58:36 命令にないから。
00:58:38 命令が…。
00:58:41 じゃ、もういいよ！
00:58:46 綾波だよね・・・？
00:58:49 Yes, Ayanami Rei. 
00:58:51 だったら、あの時助けたよね・・・？
00:58:55 ...I don't know.
00:59:04 Ikari-kun...?
00:59:11 助けて＃＃ったんだ・・・。
00:59:15 Ayanami...
00:59:18 何もしない…。
00:59:21 (Shinji's head: Asuka)
00:59:23 Get in the Eva!
00:59:27 (Shinji's head: Asuka)
00:59:30 (Shinji's head: ???)
00:59:32 (Shinji's head: Asuka)
00:59:34 Get in the Eva!
00:59:37 (Shinji's head: Asuka)
00:59:40 Father...
00:59:42 Get in the Eva!
00:59:46 Get in the Eva!
(etc.)
01:00:00 Get in the Eva!
01:00:08 何してたんだ僕は・・・。
01:00:47 最後の執行者がついに完全していたか。
01:00:50 ああ、これで道具を全て＃った。
01:00:57 The time has come, Ikari Shinji-kun. 
01:01:02 No! 
01:01:05 I don't want to pilot Eva anymore. 
01:01:07 I didn't save Ayanami after all. 
01:01:10 Nothing good came out of me piloting the Eva. 
01:01:13 I've had enough! I don't want to do anything!! 
01:01:16 And so, nothing good will come out of being refrained by unpleasant feelings.
01:01:24 Nothing is ever good! 
01:01:26 You were the one who showed me that, Kaworu. A world where nothing can be done! 
01:01:32 Things that were changed by Eva, we can just change them again with Eva. 
01:01:37 Even if you say that, my father, Eva, Misato-san, I can't believe anything and anyone! 
01:01:43 Still, I want you to believe in me. 
01:01:46 I can't! 
01:01:49 Misato-san put this thing on me! 
01:01:53 They said to never pilot Eva again. 
01:01:55 They said if I pilot, I will die. 
01:01:59 I don't care about Eva anymore. 
01:02:09 I know. 
01:02:10 I will shoulder the burdens of the curse of Lilin, along with the risk of Eva's awakening for you. 
01:02:21 Kaworu-kun... 
01:02:24 You don't have to worry. Because I was originally something created by the Lilin who fear me. 
01:02:29 I had intended to do this at some stage. 
01:02:34 Ikari Shinji-kun. Your only hope are the two Spears left at the Impact epicenter in Dogma. 
01:02:41 That is the key to activating Instrumentality. 
01:02:45 All we have to do is obtain those Spears. 
01:02:48 If we do that, Nerv will not be able to cause Fourth Impact. 
01:02:52 If we use them together with Eva-13, it becomes possible to fix the world. 
01:02:58 You're right.. 
01:03:03 Yes. It is possible for you. 
01:03:05 It is possible WITH you. 
01:03:07 Eva-13 is a double entry system. 
01:03:11 Let the two of us become the hope of Lilin. 
01:03:15 Because the thing that you need the most right now, is hope, 
01:03:19 atonement and an open heart. 
01:03:25 You're amazing. You know everything. 
01:03:30 That's because I am always thinking about you. 
01:03:35 Thank you, Nagisa-kun. 
01:03:38 "Kaworu" is fine. 
01:03:42 Ah, okay. "Shinji" is fine for me, too. 
01:03:49 It is the same as playing piano. Good things will come if we do it together. 
01:03:56 Let's go. Kaworu-kun. 
01:04:38 Evangelion 13, start up! 
01:04:44 Incoming signal! Activation of a new type of Eva confirmed. 
01:05:06 We're not alone. 
01:05:10 You mean the Mark.09? It's here as our backup. 
01:05:12 It will warn us to any Wille activity. 
01:05:15 The two of us should be enough for all that. 
01:05:18 She isn't even Ayanami... 
01:05:22 Not... Ayanami? 
01:05:28 The wall(s)...? 
01:05:30 Yes, all of the failures of infinity. 
01:05:38 Don't let them weigh upon your mind. 
01:05:42 We're nearly at Lilith's barrier. 
01:05:45 The Main Shaft is completely blocked, 
01:05:47 keeping anyone from intruding over the past 14 years. 
01:05:56 It's like one big lid.
01:06:00 It's all right. Eva-13 was made for breaking through this. 
01:06:03 The two of us can do it. 
01:06:15 Try to join tempos. Remember the piano duet. 
01:06:24 Let's go, Shinji-kun. 
01:06:48 We did it! 
01:07:07 We've arrived. The deepest part of Central Dogma. 
01:07:14 The epicenter of Third Impact. 
01:07:21 Is this Lilith? 
01:07:23 It once was. It is her corpse. 
01:07:27 Misato-san, even though we tried to protect it with our lives... 
01:07:32 Uh.... That's an Eva? 
01:07:35 Yes, the Eva Mark.06. 
01:07:38 Remodeled into an independent type, exploitation by the Lilin brought the unit to a state of ruin. 
01:07:48 The things that are piercing them... are our targets?
01:07:52 Yes, the Spears of Longinus and Cassius. Wielding both requires two souls.
01:08:00 That is why we have the Double Entry System.
01:08:04 If that's the case, why can't we just use the "other pilot" behind us?
01:08:08 No, a Lilin imitation cannot be used.
01:08:10 Their souls' placement is not right for it. [lit. differs (from the usual condition)]
01:08:14 Well, let's begin.
01:08:23 Hold on. Something is wrong.
01:08:26 What is it, Kaworu-kun?
01:08:31 This is not right... Both of the Spears have changed into a similar shape.
01:08:36 Let's just pull the Spears quickly!
01:08:38 That's why we came here in this Eva.
01:08:44 What's going on?!
01:08:55 Eva-02? 
01:08:57 Asuka!
01:09:00 What are you doing, Asuka?!
01:09:05 Stupid Shinji?! 
01:09:06 I can't believe it, you're piloting an Eva!?
01:09:09 That's right. I'm going to change the world with this Eva!
01:09:14 You little brat...
01:09:15 だったら、乗るなァ！
01:09:25 Support fire, you're always late!
01:09:27 Sorry, sorry!
01:09:28 Adams' Vessel-san,
01:09:31 allow me to stop your plan, at least...
01:09:54 Why are you interfering, Asuka? 
01:09:56 Those are our Spears of Hope! 
01:10:01 Stop... looking!... for trouble!
01:10:05 You brat, Shinji! 
01:10:06 Are you planning to start Third Impact again?
01:10:09 You're wrong! I'm trying to fix everything! 
01:10:12 I'm trying to save the world!
01:10:16 You really are a little twerp.
01:10:20 You just don't get it!
01:10:30 Kaworu-kun, why aren't you helping?
01:10:34 Cassius and Longinus. Both of the Spears are needed...
01:10:39 But the only two Spears that are here are the same...
01:10:43 Kaworu-kun!
01:10:45 That's it! Now I understand,
01:10:48 Lilin!
01:10:55 Seele temp pilot,
01:10:58 You can hear me, right?
01:11:00 Don't you think you should get out before you turn into an Adams' Vessel?
01:11:04 No. That is not the order I received.
01:11:07 Talk about a square.
01:11:09 You know your original was a whole lot more friendly?
01:11:12 Original? 
01:11:14 The other me...
01:11:30 Kaworu-kun? What's the matter?
01:11:45 Asuka... Please! 
01:11:48 Stay out of our way!
01:11:49 Go down quietly, you little brat!
01:11:47 Of all times... Hey, Glasses! I need a spare!
01:12:08 While we still have the chance! The Spears!
01:12:11 You'd raise a hand against a girl... You're the worst.
01:12:15 Spare, incoming!
01:12:28 Let's stop, Shinji-kun. I have a bad feeling about this...
01:12:32 We can't, Kaworu-kun! We came here to do something!
01:12:37 Enough! These aren't the Spears we came for!
01:12:41 Not... the Spears we came for?
01:12:47 You're the one who said we need the Spears.
01:12:50 That's why I got into this Eva!
01:12:57 The control system...?
01:13:02 For Kaworu-kun, for everyone, I will get the Spears!
01:13:07 Only then will the world go back to how it should be.
01:13:11 If I do that, even Misato-san will...
01:13:15 Damn!
01:13:16 Glasses! Get rid of the barrier!
01:13:18 You're cleared to use AA ammo!
01:13:20 I've been waiting for this.
01:13:22 Check out these babies!
01:13:30 No A.T. Field?
01:13:32 Don't tell me this unit...
01:13:46 Don't do it, Shinji-kun!
01:13:48 Stop, you stupid brat!
01:14:13 Let's begin, Fuyutsuki.
01:14:22 Eva Mark.06?
01:14:25 Pattern blue? What's going on?
01:14:30 This is bad! The 12th Angel is still alive!
01:14:35 Glasses, Container No.3!
01:14:37 Got it!
01:14:40 I'll sort out these guys before Third Impact can start up again!
01:14:49 This is the order I received.
01:15:00 An Angel!?
01:15:10 Princess, you should cease the futile fire. The whole thing is a core.
01:15:17 With just us, it's impossible to hurt that thing.
01:15:21 Besides that, by defeating the Last Angel, 
01:15:24 we don't know what kind of evil will come out.
01:15:26 You're worried, no?
01:15:32 This is...
01:15:37 This is... me?
01:15:41 What am I...?
01:15:46 The controls aren't working. What's going on, Kaworu-kun?
01:15:51 Kaworu-kun!!
01:15:53 I never imagined that I, the First Angel,
01:15:56 would be demoted to the Thirteenth. 
01:16:00 What are you doing, Kaworu-kun?
01:16:04 So the beginning and the end are the same.
01:16:08 I'd expect as much from the King of the Lilin,
01:16:11 Shinji-kun's father!
01:16:13 DSS choker, pattern blue?
01:16:15 A 13th, even though the 12th should have been the last?
01:16:19 So this is what Gendo-kun is aiming for.
01:16:24 It is time to amend the Dead Sea Scrolls' contract.
01:16:29 This is farewell.
01:16:33 Even though all of you have changed the shape of your souls,
01:16:37 You are still lifeforms blessed with the Fruit of Knowledge.
01:16:41 You were able to live for eternity,
01:16:44 But, same as us, you still cannot escape the fate of death.
01:16:50 To advance the evolution of the flock burdened with death,
01:16:54 You had bestowed upon us the gift of civilization.
01:17:00 As the representative of humanity, I say thank you.
01:17:04 By death, we will return you to where they belong.
01:17:12 The long desired Human Instrumentality Project, 
01:17:15 and the contracted deicide, will be completed by me.
01:17:19 Rest assured.
01:17:21 Our wishes have come to fruition. Good.
01:17:26 Everything is good. 
01:17:29 We hope for the peaceful purificiation of all souls, Human Instrumentality.
01:18:06 Damn it! It's entering its pseudo-evolved form!
01:18:09 Guess it's awakening... 
01:18:12 It's one of the surviving Adams. 
01:18:49 What the?!
01:19:04 What the fuck is this?
01:19:11 It's all because of me. I pulled the spears！
01:19:22 コレって・・・！！
01:19:24 Fourth Impact...
01:19:29 These are the opening ceremonies.
01:19:45 Kaworu-kun... the choker!
01:19:55 Misato-san?!
01:19:59 A.T. Field at maximum!
01:20:02 Contain the Eva in its present state!
01:20:03 Preparing a volley from the main battery! ???? charged!
01:02:03 ＃＃＃＃＃、強化だん＃＃＃＃！
01:20:06 Do whatever it takes to keep Fourth Impact in check!
01:20:08 Attack!!
01:20:17 Damage received! Direct hit to main armament!
01:20:19 An Adams' Vessel?!
01:20:26 Shots received on midsection! Damage unknown!
01:20:28 The target is the new-type Eva! ＃＃＃＃
01:20:30 Rudder is ineffective!
01:20:32 We're losing altitude!
01:20:43 中＃＃＃＃＃＃！
01:20:46 The Adams' Vessel... It intends to take Wunder's controls 
01:20:48 back from Eva-01, the ship's primary master!
01:20:57 Why can't I restore the link?
01:21:04 Bit by bit...
01:21:06 Oh, man! ########
01:21:10 Four eyes, ＃＃＃＃＃
01:21:12 ＃＃＃＃＃に助ける。
01:21:14 Righty-o, the Adams' Vessel. 
01:21:15 Unable to reject the Adams' Vessel!
01:21:17 ＃＃のシステムに、＃＃＃進入！
01:21:20 ＃＃＃＃＃＃＃コアできます！
01:21:44 ＃＃＃！命令＃＃＃＃ことね！

01:21:55 Code 777 (Triple Seven)!
（Asuka enters Beast Mode)
01:22:04 Who's there?
01:22:05 Who the hell are YOU?!
01:22:24 ＃＃＃＃＃＃！＃＃弐号機、あと＃＃＃！
01:22:27 頼むは、アスカ。
01:22:48 こんな時・・・綾波レイなら、どうする？
01:22:51 知るか！
01:22:58 あんたはどうしたいの！！
01:23:09 Geez! The whole thing's a core?
01:23:12 No time...
01:23:14 Sorry, Eva-02!
（Eva-02 self-destructs）
01:23:31 ＃＃＃システム＃＃＃。
01:23:33 ＃＃＃＃発信！目標のエヴァ＃＃＃＃！
01:23:36 はい！（？）
01:23:37 ＃＃＃＃＃される無理！
01:23:40 Shinji-kun...
01:24:02 僕の＃＃なのか・・・。
01:24:06 僕が・・・。
01:24:12 It's not your fault. 
01:24:15 It's because I became the 13th Angel. 
01:24:19 I'm the trigger. 
01:24:21 What do I do?
01:24:24 Hey... what do I do?
01:24:31 Kaworu-kun,
01:24:34 tell me what the right thing would be.
01:24:37 Even if souls disappear, hopes and curses will remain in this world.
01:24:43 Intent is imparted to the world as information/data and changes (continuously). 
01:24:48 In time, even one's very self is being rewritten. 
01:24:54 I'm sorry. This isn't the happiness you wished for. 
01:24:59 I will close the Door of Guf. 
01:25:03 You don't need to worry about it, Shinji-kun. 
01:25:05 Kaworu-kun... 
01:25:08 What are you saying, Kaworu-kun?
01:25:11 I don't get any of it!
01:25:18 Shinji-kun, you should find a place of peace and self. 
01:25:31 Fate will surely guide you. 
01:25:37 Don't make that face. 
01:25:41 We'll meet again, Shinji-kun. 
01:25:44 Kaworu-kun!!!
(*splat*)
01:26:04 The Door of Guf hasn't closed yet?
01:26:06 So, Puppy Boy is Seele's backup measure! 
01:26:25 I'm done cleaning up! Hang in there, Puppy Boy!
01:26:30 Don't be such a baby! Help out the Princess, at least! Be a man! 
01:26:36 And while you're at it, get to know the world a little!
01:27:33 What dreadful circumstances. Most of it is according to Seele's plans.
01:27:38 But the removal of Seele's boy led to Eva-13 also awakening. 
01:27:46 Captain Katsuragi's actions are within predications, as well.
01:27:49 This will do for now. 
01:27:53 第二＃＃＃＃＃＃＃（BGの日向)

01:28:07 ミサト、今はそれで良しとしましょう・・・・。
（アスカ、シンジのコアまで歩いて行き、中でうずくまってるシンジを見つける）
01:29:01 You brat, Shinji. 
01:29:04 助けてくれないんだ？私を。
01:29:10 また自分の事ばっかり。黙ってりゃ済むと思ってる
01:29:40 まだ甘えてる。
01:29:43 いつまで立っても手間のかかるガキね！
01:29:47 ほら、これ付けて。
01:29:50 もー！立ってる位自分で出来るでしょ！
01:29:58 The pilot from earlier.
01:30:02 From an early lot of Ayanami Types? 
01:30:11 ここじゃエル結界密度が強すぎて、助けに来れないわ
01:30:16 リリンが近づける所まで移動するわよ。
01:30:23 Look!
01:35:?? PREVIEW
01:35:12 Shinji Ikari continues to wander, still lacking the will to live. 
01:35:16 He comes upon a place that teaches him hope. 
01:36:19 Finally the instrumentality project is set in motion. 
01:36:22 To prevent Final Impact, 
01:36:23 Wille make one last grueling stand. 
01:36:26 Wunder tears through the skies! 
01:36:27 Eva Unit 8+2 sprints over the red earth! 
01:36:32 Next time in "New Evangelion Theatrical Edition".
01:36:34 There'll be fan service all the way up to the end!
